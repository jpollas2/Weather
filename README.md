Houses a project that scrapes weather.com for current conditions and future conditions (day and hourly)

#### - Project Status: [Active]

## Intro/Objective
Project was created while working nights and 45 miles from the office.  This project's goal was to automate my process of checking the weather, and run automatically while I was eathing/getting ready.  Saved 5 minutes or so, and allowed me to sleep a bit longer, which was a precious resource at the time.

## Methods Used
* Web Scraping
* HTML

## Technologies
* Python
* Weather.com

## Requirements/Imports
Python 3.8.1
Requests
BeautifulSoup

## Description
The first step of this project was to learn to scrape and get the required information from Weather.com.  The next step was to put it into an easy to read/quick glance report, which required learning HTML formatting.
****6. Next Steps:**** Create a batch file that will allow the user to manually input which city to gather data for.  Will require getting city specific codes from weather.com into a dictionary.
